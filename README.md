# Python_Multi-waypoint_Solution

This expands the previousy published flight-control solution to incorporate multiple, user-defined waypoints from a csv text file.  Individual user-defined drone hover-time duration settings can also be applied for each point.

Values must be inputted, via file, as follows:
X, Y, Z, Time (sec)

An example file has been included for reference.

NOTES: 
- Intended to be used in conjunction with Symbiosis Flight-Control application in the Unity Environment, however can function as a stand-alone application.
- Requires Python 3.6 or later (https://www.python.org/downloads/) be installed and executable added to PATH
